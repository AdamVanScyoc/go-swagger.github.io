2.0    \n   \nDevelopment of this toolkit is sponsored by VMware  \nContains an implementation of Swagger 2.0 (aka OpenAPI 2.0). It knows how to serialize and deserialize swagger specifications.\nSwagger is a simple yet powerful representation of your RESTful API.With the largest ecosystem of API tooling on the planet, thousands of developers are supporting Swagger in almost every modern programming language and deployment environment.\nWith a Swagger-enabled API, you get interactive documentation, client SDK generation and discoverability. We created Swagger to help fulfill the promise of APIs.\nSwagger helps companies like Apigee, Getty Images, Intuit, LivingSocial, McKesson, Microsoft, Morningstar, and PayPal build the best possible services with RESTful APIs. Now in version 2.0, Swagger is more enabling than ever. And it's 100% open source software.\nHow is this different from go generator in swagger-codegen?\ntl;dr The main difference at this moment is that this one will actually work.\nThe swagger-codegen project only generates a client and even there it will only support flat models.\n\nThis project supports most features offered by jsonschema including polymorphism.\nIt allows for generating a swagger specification from go code.\nIt allows for generating a server from a swagger definition and to generate an equivalent spec back from that codebase.\nIt allows for generating a client from a swagger definition.\nIt has support for several common swagger vendor extensions.\n\nWhy is this not done in the swagger-codegen project? Because:\n\nI don't really know java very well and so I'd be learning both java and the object model of the codegen which was in heavy flux as opposed to doing go and I really wanted to go experience of designing a large codebase with it.\nGo's super limited type system makes it so that it doesn't fit well in the model of swagger-codegen\nGo's idea of polymorphism doesn't reconcile very well with a solution designed for languages that actually have inheritance and so forth.\nFor supporting types like [][][]map[string][][]int64 I don't think it's possible with mustache\nI gravely underestimated the amount of work that would be involved in making something useful out of it.\nMy personal mission: I want the jvm to go away, it was great way back when now it's just silly (vm in container on vm in vm in container)\n\nWhat's inside?\nHere is an outline of available features (see the full list here):\n\n[x] An object model that serializes to swagger-compliant yaml or json\n[x] A tool to work with swagger\n\n[x] Serve swagger UI for any swagger spec file\n[x] Flexible code generation, with customizable templates\n\n[x] Generate API based on swagger spec\n[x] Generate go client from a swagger spec\n\n\n[x] Validate a swagger spec document, with extra rules outlined here\n\n[x] Validate against jsonschema (Draft 4), with full $ref support\n[x] Generate spec document based on annotated code\n\n\n[x] Middlewares\n\n[x] serve spec\n[x] routing\n[x] validation\n[x] additional validation through an interface\n[x] authorization\n[x] swagger docs UI\n\n\n[x] Typed JSON Schema implementation\n\n[x] Extended string and numeric formats\n[x] Project documentation site\n[x] Play nice with golint, go vet etc.\n\nDocumentation\nhttps://goswagger.io\nInstalling\nInstalling from binary distributions\ngo-swagger releases are distributed as binaries that are built from signed tags.

Just like swagger, this does not cover code generated by the toolkit. That code is entirely yours to license however you see fit.\nFAQ\nhttps://goswagger.io/faq/\n"},"about.html":{"url":"about.html","title":"Approach","keywords":"","body":"What is go-swagger?\nThere are 2 axes along which your API and its documentation tend to evolve. This toolkit aims to support you along all\naxes and remove the repetitive nature of writing what is essentially boilerplate code for faster iteration times.\n\nDesign first approach\nThe first one is an artifact of that first meeting where you hash out what your service will do. Hopefully you've come\nup with some document that services as a kind of contract for what the affected people/teams will need to do.\nAt this stage you want to be able to generate a server, perhaps a client to talk to that server.\nIt's not inconceivable you want to have your front-end team use mock data for that server and that the back-end team\nwants to be left in peace while they work on their part of the application.\nThis is the design first approach for swagger.\nCode first approach\nNow we're moving on to the second iteration of the project and at this stage, there might be a design meeting for the\nnew features, or they might just be refinements of the previous APIs. When no changes are required to the contract,\nall is great because people can keep doing what they were doing and everybody is happy.\nHowever it might be that there was a change that is required for the front-end, they need a boolean added to some model\nbecause they want to display an-accepted-terms-and-conditions-checkbox.\nThe back-end can decide to add this to the code, provide the necessary annotation and regenerate the swagger\nspecification document.\nThis is the code first approach for swagger.\nThe toolkit\nThis toolkit aims to support both these modes, remove the repetitive nature of writing what is essentially boilerplate\ncode.\nIn doing so it tries to stay as close as possible to the go stdlib interfaces, it tries to have no opinions\nbesides the fact that documentation is important. And it tries to integrate well with the rest of the go ecosystem as\nwell as the swagger ecosystem.\nA series of contrib projects will add higher level optional functionality so that you can use the generated code with\nconfidence whether your application is your personal blog or is the next AWS.\n"},"features.html":{"url":"features.html","title":"Features","keywords":"","body":"Full features list\nFor a V1 I want to have this feature set completed:\n\n[x] An object model that serializes to swagger yaml or json\n[x] A tool to work with swagger\n\n[x] Serve swagger UI for any swagger spec file\n[x] Flexible code generation, with customizable templates\n[x] Generate API based on swagger spec\n[x] Generate go client from a swagger spec\n[x] Validate a swagger spec document, with extra rules outlined here\n\n[x] definition can't declare a property that's already defined by one of its ancestors (Error)\n[x] definition's ancestor can't be a descendant of the same model (Error)\n[x] each api path should be non-verbatim (account for path param names) unique per method (Error)\n[x] each path parameter should correspond to a parameter placeholder and vice versa (Error)\n[x] path parameter declarations do not allow empty names (/path/{} is not valid) (Error)\n[x] each definition property listed in the required array must be defined in the properties of the model (Error)\n[x] each parameter should have a unique name and in combination (Error)\n[x] each operation should have at most 1 parameter of type body (Error)\n[x] each operation cannot have both a body parameter and a formData parameter (Error)\n[x] each operation must have an unique operationId (Error)\n[x] each reference must point to a valid object (Error)\n[x] every default value that is specified must validate against the schema for that property (Error)\n[x] items property is required for all schemas/definitions of type array (Error)\n|x] param in path must have the property required: true\n[ ] every example that is specified must validate against the schema for that property (Error)\n[ ] $ref should not have siblings (Warning)\n[x] each referable definition must have references (Warning)\n\n\n[x] Validate against jsonschema (Draft 4), with full $ref support\n\n[x] Generate spec document based on annotated code\n\n[x] generate meta data (top level swagger properties) from package docs\n[x] generate definition entries for models\n[x] support composed structs out of several embeds\n[x] support allOf for composed structs\n[x] generate path entries for routes\n[x] generate responses from structs\n[x] support composed structs out of several embeds\n[x] generate parameters from structs\n[x] support composed structs out of several embeds\n\n\n\n\n[x] Middlewares\n\n[x] serve spec\n[x] routing\n[x] validation\n[x] additional validation through an interface\n[x] authorization\n\n[x] basic auth\n[x] api key auth\n[x] oauth2 bearer auth\n\n\n[x] swagger docs UI\n\n\n\n[x] Typed JSON Schema implementation\n\n[x] JSON Pointer that knows about structs\n[x] JSON Reference that knows about structs\n[x] Passes current json schema test suite\n\n\n[x] extended string and numeric formats\n\n[x] uuid, uuid3, uuid4, uuid5\n[x] email\n[x] uri (absolute)\n[x] hostname\n[x] ipv4\n[x] ipv6\n[x] mac\n[x] credit card\n[x] isbn, isbn10, isbn13\n[x] social security number\n[x] hexcolor\n[x] rgbcolor\n[x] date\n[x] date-time\n[x] duration\n[x] password\n[x] custom string formats\n[x] int32, int64, float, double\n\n\n[x] Project documentation site\n\n[x] Play nice with golint, go vet etc.\n\n"},"tutorial/todo-list.html":{"url":"tutorial/todo-list.html","title":"Simple Server","keywords":"","body":"Todo List Tutorial\nThis example walks you through a hypothetical project, building a todo list.\nIt uses a todo list because this is well-understood application, so you can focus on the go-swagger pieces. In this example we build a server and a client.\n\nTo create your application start with swagger init:\nswagger init spec \\\n  --title \"A Todo list application\" \\\n  --description \"From the todo list tutorial on goswagger.io\" \\\n  --version 1.0.0 \\\n  --scheme http \\\n  --consumes application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json \\\n  --produces application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json\nThis gives you a skeleton swagger.yml file:\n---\nconsumes:\n- application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json\ndefinitions: {}\ninfo:\n  description: From the todo list tutorial on goswagger.io\n  title: A Todo list application\n  version: 1.0.0\npaths: {}\nproduces:\n- application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json\nschemes:\n- http\nswagger: \"2.0\"\n\nThis doesn't do much but it does pass validation:\n± ~/go/src/github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/examples/tutorials/todo-list\ngit:(master) ✗ ? » swagger validate ./swagger.yml\nThe swagger spec at \"./swagger.yml\" is valid against swagger specification 2.0\nNow that you have an empty but valid specification document, it's time to declare some models and endpoints for the API. You'll need a model to represent a todo item, so you can define that in the definitions section:\n---\ndefinitions:\n  item:\n    type: object\n    required:\n      - description\n    properties:\n      id:\n        type: integer\n        format: int64\n        readOnly: true\n      description:\n        type: string\n        minLength: 1\n      completed:\n        type: boolean\n\nIn this model definition we say that the model item is an object with a required property description. This item model has 3 properties: id, description, and completed. The id property is an int64 value and is marked as readOnly, meaning that it will be provided by the API server and it will be ignored when the item is created.\nThis document also says that the description must be at least 1 char long, which results in a string property that's not a pointer.\nAt this moment you have enough so that actual code could be generated, but let's continue defining the rest of the API so that the code generation will be more useful. Now that you have a model so you can add some endpoints to list the todo's:\n---\npaths:\n  /:\n    get:\n      tags:\n        - todos\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: list the todo operations\n          schema:\n            type: array\n            items:\n              $ref: \"#/definitions/item\"\n\nThis snippet of yaml defines a GET / operation and tags it with todos. Tagging things is useful for many tools, for example helping UI tools group endpoints appropriately. Code generators might turn them into 'controllers'. There is also a response defined with a generic description about the response content. Note that some generators will put the description into the http status message. The response also defines endpoint's return type. In this case the endpoint returns a list of todo items, so the schema is an array and the array will contain item objects, which you defined previously.\nBut wait a minute, what if there are 100's of todo items, will we just return all of them for everybody?  It would be good to add a since and limit param here. The ids will have to be ordered for a since param to work but you're in control of that so that's fine.\n---\npaths:\n  /:\n    get:\n      tags:\n        - todos\n      parameters:\n        - name: since\n          in: query\n          type: integer\n          format: int64\n        - name: limit\n          in: query\n          type: integer\n          format: int32\n          default: 20\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: list the todo operations\n          schema:\n            type: array\n            items:\n              $ref: \"#/definitions/item\"\n\nWith this new version of the operation you now have query params. These parameters have defaults so users can leave them off and the API will still function as intended.\nHowever, this definition is extremely optimistic and only defines a response for the \"happy path\". It's very likely that the API will need to return errors too. That means you have to define a model errors, as well as at least one more response definition to cover the error response.\nThe error definition looks like this:\n---\ndefinitions:\n  error:\n    type: object\n    required:\n      - message\n    properties:\n      code:\n        type: integer\n        format: int64\n      message:\n        type: string\n\nFor the error response you can use the default response, on the assumption that every successful response from your API is defying the odds.\n---\npaths:\n  /:\n    get:\n      tags:\n        - todos\n      parameters:\n        - name: since\n          in: query\n          type: integer\n          format: int64\n        - name: limit\n          in: query\n          type: integer\n          format: int32\n          default: 20\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: list the todo operations\n          schema:\n            type: array\n            items:\n              $ref: \"#/definitions/item\"\n        default:\n          description: generic error response\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/error\"\n\nAt this point you've defined your first endpoint completely. To improve the strength of this contract you could define responses for each of the status codes and perhaps return different error messages for different statuses. For now, the status code will be provided in the error message.\nTry validating the specification again with swagger validate ./swagger.yml to ensure that code generation will work as expected. Generating code from an invalid specification leads to unpredictable results.\nYour completed spec should look like this:\n---\nswagger: \"2.0\"\ninfo:\n  description: From the todo list tutorial on goswagger.io\n  title: A Todo list application\n  version: 1.0.0\nconsumes:\n- application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json\nproduces:\n- application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json\nschemes:\n- http\npaths:\n  /:\n    get:\n      tags:\n        - todos\n      parameters:\n        - name: since\n          in: query\n          type: integer\n          format: int64\n        - name: limit\n          in: query\n          type: integer\n          format: int32\n          default: 20\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: list the todo operations\n          schema:\n            type: array\n            items:\n              $ref: \"#/definitions/item\"\n        default:\n          description: generic error response\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/error\"\ndefinitions:\n  item:\n    type: object\n    required:\n      - description\n    properties:\n      id:\n        type: integer\n        format: int64\n        readOnly: true\n      description:\n        type: string\n        minLength: 1\n      completed:\n        type: boolean\n  error:\n    type: object\n    required:\n      - message\n    properties:\n      code:\n        type: integer\n        format: int64\n      message:\n        type: string\n\nWhen you generate a server for this spec you'll see the following output:\n± ~/go/src/github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/examples/tutorials/todo-list/server-1\ngit:(master) ✗ !?

You see that the parameters are defined using a schema that references our exist item model. Remember that we defined this object's id key as readOnly, so it will not be accepted as part of the POST body.\nNext you can define a DELETE to remove a todo item from the list:\n---\npaths:\n  /{id}:\n    delete:\n      tags:\n        - todos\n      operationId: destroyOne\n      parameters:\n        - type: integer\n          format: int64\n          name: id\n          in: path\n          required: true\n      responses:\n        204:\n          description: Deleted\n        default:\n          description: error\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/error\"\n\nThis time you're you're defining a parameter that is part of the path. This operation will look in the URI templated path for an id. Since there's nothing to return after a delete, the success response  is 204 No Content.\nFinally, you need to define a way to update an existing item:\n---\npaths:\n  /{id}:\n    parameters:\n      - type: integer\n        format: int64\n        name: id\n        in: path\n        required: true\n    put:\n      tags: [\"todos\"]\n      operationId: updateOne\n      parameters:\n        - name: body\n          in: body\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/item\"\n      responses:\n        '200':\n          description: OK\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/item\"\n        default:\n          description: error\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/error\"\n    delete:\n      # elided for brevity\n\nThere are two approaches typically taken for updates. A PUT indicates that the entire entity is being replaced, and a PATCH indicates that only the fields provided in the request should be updated. In the above example, you can see that the PUT \"brute force\" approach is being used.\nAnother thing to note is that because the /{id} path is shared for both DELETE and PUT, they can share a parameters definition.\nAt this point you should have a complete specification for the todo list API:\n---\nswagger: \"2.0\"\ninfo:\n  description: From the todo list tutorial on goswagger.io\n  title: A Todo list application\n  version: 1.0.0\nconsumes:\n- application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json\nproduces:\n- application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json\nschemes:\n- http\n- https\npaths:\n  /:\n    get:\n      tags:\n        - todos\n      operationId: findTodos\n      parameters:\n        - name: since\n          in: query\n          type: integer\n          format: int64\n        - name: limit\n          in: query\n          type: integer\n          format: int32\n          default: 20\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: list the todo operations\n          schema:\n            type: array\n            items:\n              $ref: \"#/definitions/item\"\n        default:\n          description: generic error response\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/error\"\n    post:\n      tags:\n        - todos\n      operationId: addOne\n      parameters:\n        - name: body\n          in: body\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/item\"\n      responses:\n        201:\n          description: Created\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/item\"\n        default:\n          description: error\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/error\"\n  /{id}:\n    parameters:\n      - type: integer\n        format: int64\n        name: id\n        in: path\n        required: true\n    put:\n      tags:\n        - todos\n      operationId: updateOne\n      parameters:\n        - name: body\n          in: body\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/item\"\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: OK\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/item\"\n        default:\n          description: error\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/error\"\n    delete:\n      tags:\n        - todos\n      operationId: destroyOne\n      responses:\n        204:\n          description: Deleted\n        default:\n          description: error\n          schema:\n            $ref: \"#/definitions/error\"\ndefinitions:\n  item:\n    type: object\n    required:\n      - description\n    properties:\n      id:\n        type: integer\n        format: int64\n        readOnly: true\n      description:\n        type: string\n        minLength: 1\n      completed:\n        type: boolean\n  error:\n    type: object\n    required:\n      - message\n    properties:\n      code:\n        type: integer\n        format: int64\n      message:\n        type: string\n\nThis is a good time to sanity check and by validating the schema:\n± ~/go/src/github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/examples/tutorials/todo-list/server-2\ngit:(master) ✗ !? » swagger validate ./swagger.yml\nThe swagger spec at \"./swagger.yml\" is valid against swagger specification 2.0\nNow you're ready to generate the API and start filling in the actual operations:\ngit:(master) ✗ !? » swagger generate server -A TodoList -f ./swagger.yml\n... elided output ...\n2015/12/31 18:16:28 rendered main template: server.TodoList\n± ~/go/src/github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/examples/tutorials/todo-list/server-2\ngit:(master) ✗ !? » tree\n.\n├── cmd\n│   └── todo-list-server\n│       └── main.go\n├── models\n│   ├── error.go\n│   ├── find_todos_okbody.go\n│   └── item.go\n├── restapi\n│   ├── configure_todo_list.go\n│   ├── doc.go\n│   ├── embedded_spec.go\n│   ├── operations\n│   │   ├── todo_list_api.go\n│   │   └── todos\n│   │       ├── add_one.go\n│   │       ├── add_one_parameters.go\n│   │       ├── add_one_responses.go\n│   │       ├── add_one_urlbuilder.go\n│   │       ├── destroy_one.go\n│   │       ├── destroy_one_parameters.go\n│   │       ├── destroy_one_responses.go\n│   │       ├── destroy_one_urlbuilder.go\n│   │       ├── find_todos.go\n│   │       ├── find_todos_parameters.go\n│   │       ├── find_todos_responses.go\n│   │       ├── find_todos_urlbuilder.go\n│   │       ├── update_one.go\n│   │       ├── update_one_parameters.go\n│   │       ├── update_one_responses.go\n│   │       └── update_one_urlbuilder.go\n│   └── server.go\n└── swagger.yml\n\n6 directories, 26 files\nTo implement the core of your application you start by editing restapi/configure_todo_list.go. This file is safe to edit. Its content will not be overwritten if you run swagger generate again the future.\nThe simplest way to implement this application is to simply store all the todo items in a golang map. This provides a simple way to move forward without bringing in complications like a database or files.\nTo do this you'll need a map and a counter to track the last assigned id:\n// the variables we need throughout our implementation\nvar items = make(map[int64]*models.Item)\nvar lastID int64\n\nThe simplest handler to implement now is the delete handler. Because the store is a map and the id of the item is provided in the request it's a one liner.\napi.TodosDestroyOneHandler = todos.DestroyOneHandlerFunc(func(params todos.DestroyOneParams) middleware.Responder {\n  delete(items, params.ID)\n  return todos.NewDestroyOneNoContent()\n})\n\nAfter deleting the item from the store, you need to provide a response. The code generator created responders for each response you defined in the the swagger specification, and you can see how one of those is being used in the example above.\nThe other 3 handler implementations are similar to this one. They are provided in the source for this tutorial.\nSo assuming you go ahead and implement the remainder of the endpoints, you're all set to test it out:\n» curl -i localhost:8765\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json\nDate: Fri, 01 Jan 2016 19:56:01 GMT\nContent-Length: 3\n\n[]\n\n± ~/go/src/github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/examples/tutorials/todo-list/server-complete\n» curl -i localhost:8765 -d \"{\\\"description\\\":\\\"message $RANDOM\\\"}\"\nHTTP/1.1 415 Unsupported Media Type\nContent-Type: application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json\nDate: Fri, 01 Jan 2016 19:56:11 GMT\nContent-Length: 157\n\n{\"code\":415,\"message\":\"unsupported media type \\\"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\\\", only [application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json] are allowed\"}                                                                                                     ± ~/go/src/github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/examples/tutorials/todo-list/server-complete\n\n» curl -i localhost:8765 -d \"{\\\"description\\\":\\\"message $RANDOM\\\"}\" -H 'Content-Type: application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json'\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nContent-Type: application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json\nDate: Fri, 01 Jan 2016 19:56:20 GMT\nContent-Length: 39\n\n{\"description\":\"message 30925\",\"id\":1}\n\n± ~/go/src/github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/examples/tutorials/todo-list/server-complete\n» curl -i localhost:8765 -d \"{\\\"description\\\":\\\"message $RANDOM\\\"}\" -H 'Content-Type: application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json'\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nContent-Type: application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json\nDate: Fri, 01 Jan 2016 19:56:23 GMT\nContent-Length: 37\n\n{\"description\":\"message 104\",\"id\":2}\n\n± ~/go/src/github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/examples/tutorials/todo-list/server-complete\n» curl -i localhost:8765 -d \"{\\\"description\\\":\\\"message $RANDOM\\\"}\" -H 'Content-Type: application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json'\nHTTP/1.1 201 Created\nContent-Type: application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json\nDate: Fri, 01 Jan 2016 19:56:24 GMT\nContent-Length: 39\n\n{\"description\":\"message 15225\",\"id\":3}\n\n± ~/go/src/github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/examples/tutorials/todo-list/server-complete\n» curl -i localhost:8765\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json\nDate: Fri, 01 Jan 2016 19:56:26 GMT\nContent-Length: 117\n\n[{\"description\":\"message 30925\",\"id\":1},{\"description\":\"message 104\",\"id\":2},{\"description\":\"message 15225\",\"id\":3}]\n\n± ~/go/src/github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/examples/tutorials/todo-list/server-complete\n» curl -i localhost:8765/3 -X PUT -H 'Content-Type: application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json' -d '{\"description\":\"go shopping\"}'\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json\nDate: Fri, 01 Jan 2016 19:56:32 GMT\nContent-Length: 37\n\n{\"description\":\"go shopping\",\"id\":3}\n\n± ~/go/src/github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/examples/tutorials/todo-list/server-complete\n» curl -i localhost:8765\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json\nDate: Fri, 01 Jan 2016 19:56:34 GMT\nContent-Length: 115\n\n[{\"description\":\"message 30925\",\"id\":1},{\"description\":\"message 104\",\"id\":2},{\"description\":\"go shopping\",\"id\":3}]\n\n± ~/go/src/github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/examples/tutorials/todo-list/server-complete\n» curl -i localhost:8765/1 -X DELETE -H 'Content-Type: application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json'\nHTTP/1.1 204 No Content\nContent-Type: application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json\nDate: Fri, 01 Jan 2016 19:57:04 GMT\n\n± ~/go/src/github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/examples/tutorials/todo-list/server-complete\n» curl -i localhost:8765\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json\nDate: Fri, 01 Jan 2016 19:57:06 GMT\nContent-Length: 76\n\n[{\"description\":\"message 104\",\"id\":2},{\"description\":\"go shopping\",\"id\":3}]\n\n"},"use/middleware.html":{"url":"use/middleware.html","title":"Middleware","keywords":"","body":"BYO middleware\nGo-swagger chose the golang net/http package as base abstraction. That means that for any supported transport by the toolkit you can reuse any middleware existing middlewares that following the stdlib middlware pattern.\n\nThere are several projects providing middleware libraries for weaving all kinds of functionality into your request handling. None of those things are the job of go-swagger, go-swagger just serves your specs.\nThe server takes care of a number of things when a request arrives:\n\nrouting\nauthentication\ninput validation\ncontent negotiation\nparameter and body binding\n\nIf you're unfamiliar with the concept of golang net/http middlewares you can read up on it here:Making and Using HTTP Middleware\nBesides serving the swagger specification as an API, the toolkit also serves the actual swagger specification document.\nThe convention is to use the /swagger.json location for serving up the specification document, so we serve the\nspecification at that path.\nAdd middleware\nThe generated server allows for 2 extension points to inject middleware in its middlware chain. These have to do with\nthe lifecycle of a request. You can find those hooks in the configure_xxx_api.go file.\nThe first one is to add middleware all the way to the top of the middleware stack. To do this you add them in the\nsetupGlobalMiddleware method. This middleware applies to everything in the go-swagger managed API.\nfunc setupGlobalMiddleware(handler http.Handler) http.Handler {\n    return handler\n}\n\nThe second extension point allows for middleware to be injected right before actually handling a matched request.\nThis excludes the swagger.json document from being affected by this middlware though.  This extension point makes the\nmiddlewares execute right after routing but right before authentication, binding and validation.  You add middlewares\nto this point by editing the setupMiddlewares method in configure_xxx_api.go\nfunc setupMiddlewares(handler http.Handler) http.Handler {\n    return handler\n}\n\nThe global middleware is an excellent place to do things like panic handling, request logging or adding metrics.  While\nthe plain middleware allows you to kind of filter this by request path without having to take care of routing. You also\nget access to the full context that the go-swagger toolkit uses throughout the lifecycle of a request.\nAdd logging and panic handling\nA very common requirement for HTTP APIs is to include some form of logging. Another one is to handle panics from your\nAPI requests.  The example for a possible implementation of this uses this community provided\nmiddleware to catch panics.\nfunc setupGlobalMiddleware(handler http.Handler) http.Handler {\n  recovery := recover.New(&recover.Options{\n    Log: log.Print,\n  })\n  return recovery(handler)\n}\n\nThere are tons of middlewares out there, some are framework specific and some frameworks don't really use the plain\nvanilla golang net/http as base abstraction. For those you can use a project like interpose that serves as an adapter\nlayer so you can still reuse middlewares. Of course nobody is stopping you to just implement your own middlewares.\nFor example using interpose to integrate with logrus.\nimport (\n  interpose \"github.com/carbocation/interpose/middleware\"\n)\nfunc setupGlobalMiddleware(handler http.Handler) http.Handler {\n  logViaLogrus := interpose.NegroniLogrus()\n  return logViaLogrus(handler)\n}\n\nAnd you can compose these middlewares into a stack using functions.\nfunc setupGlobalMiddleware(handler http.Handler) http.Handler {\n  handlePanic := recover.New(&recover.Options{\n    Log: log.Print,\n  })\n\n  logViaLogrus := interpose.NegroniLogrus()\n\n  return handlePanic(\n    logViaLogrus(\n      handler\n    )\n  )\n}\n\nAdd rate limiting\nYou can also add rate limiting in a similar way. Lets say we just want to rate limit the valid requests to our swagger\nAPI. To do so we could use tollbooth.\nfunc setupMiddlewares(handler http.Handler) http.Handler {\n  limiter := tollbooth.NewLimiter(1, time.Second)\n  limiter.IPLookups = []string{\"RemoteAddr\", \"X-Forwarded-For\", \"X-Real-IP\"}\n    return tollbooth.LimitFuncHandler(handler)\n}\n\nAnd with this you've added rate limitting to your application.\n"},"tutorial/custom-server.html":{"url":"tutorial/custom-server.html","title":"Custom Server","keywords":"","body":"Custom Server Tutorial\nIn this tutorial we'll be building up a custom server.\nThe core will be generated using a manually written and maintained OpenAPI 2.0 spec.\nThe cli code will be a thin layer around that, and will simply setup the API and server,\nusing the parsed configurations and our hand written handlers.\n\nThe server we'll building will be very simple.\nIn this tutorial we'll assume you are already familiar with defining an API,\nusing the OpenAPI 2.0 yaml specification format.\nPlease consult the official OpenAPI 2.0 specification\nfor more information in case you're new to OpenAPI (Also known as Swagger).\nThe end product of this tutorial can be found as ./examples/tutorials/custom-server.\nThe server we'll be building, will be generated using the following spec:\n---\nswagger: '2.0'\ninfo:\n  version: 1.0.0\n  title: Greeting Server\npaths:\n  /hello:\n    get:\n      produces:\n        - text/plain\n      parameters:\n        - name: name\n          required: false\n          type: string\n          in: query\n          description: defaults to World if not given\n      operationId: getGreeting\n      responses:\n        200:\n          description: returns a greeting\n          schema:\n              type: string\n              description: contains the actual greeting as plain text\n\nAs you can see, there is only 1 operation,\nallowing us to focus on how to create a custom server,\nwithout loosing track in the details of any specific implementation.\nWhere you store the specification is not important.\nBy default the swagger cli expects it to be stored as ./swagger.yml,\nbut we'll store it as ./swagger/swagger.yml, to keep our project's root folder clean and tidy.\nOnce we have our OpenAPI specification ready, it is time to generate our server.\nThis can be done using the following command, from within our root folder:\n$ swagger generate server -t gen -f ./swagger/swagger.yml --exclude-main -A greeter\nIn the command above we're specifying the -t (target) flag,\nspecifying that swagger should store all generated code in the given target directory. We're also specifying the -f flag, to explicitly define that our spec file can be found at ./swagger/swagger.yml, rather then the default ./swagger.yml. As we are writing a custom server, we also don't want the automatically generated cmd server, and is excluded using the --exclude-main flag. Finally we're also explicitly naming our server using the -A flag.\nPlease consult swagger generate server --help for more flags and information.\nOnce we've executed this command, you should have following file tree:\n├── gen\n│   └── restapi\n│       ├── configure_greeter.go\n│       ├── doc.go\n│       ├── embedded_spec.go\n│       ├── operations\n│       │   ├── get_greeting.go\n│       │   ├── get_greeting_parameters.go\n│       │   ├── get_greeting_responses.go\n│       │   ├── get_greeting_urlbuilder.go\n│       │   └── greeter_api.go\n│       └── server.go\n└── swagger\n    └── swagger.yml\nAfter generation we should find only 1 sub directory in our gen folder.\nrestapi, which contains the core server. It consists among other things out of the API (operations/greeter_api.go), operations (operations/*) and parameters (*_parameters.go).\nNote that in case we also had defined models in the global definitions section,\nthere would be a models folder as well in our gen folder,\ncontaining the generated models for those definitions.\nBut as we don't have any definitions to share, you won't find it in this tutorial.\nFor more information, read through through the generated code.\nIt might help to keep the swagger/swagger.yml definition next to you,\nto help you what is defined, for what and where.\nSo now that we have the generated server, it is time to write our actual main file.\nIn it we'll parse some simple flags that can be used to configure the server,\nwe'll setup the API and finally start the server. All in all, very minimal and simple.\nso let's start writing the ./cmd/greeter/main.go file:\nWe start by defining our flags, in our example using the standard flag pkg:\nvar portFlag = flag.Int(\"port\", 3000, \"Port to run this service on\")\n\nNow it's time to write our main logic,\nstarting by loading our embedded swagger spec.\nThis is required, as it is used to configure the dynamic server,\nthe core of our generated server (found under the ./gen/restapi dir).\nswaggerSpec, err := loads.Analyzed(restapi.SwaggerJSON, \"\")\nif err != nil {\n    log.Fatalln(err)\n}\n\nWith the spec loaded in, we can create our API and server:\napi := operations.NewGreeterAPI(swaggerSpec)\nserver := restapi.NewServer(api)\ndefer server.Shutdown()\n\nWith the server created, we can overwrite the default port, using our portFlag:\nflag.Parse()\nserver.Port = *portFlag\n\nAfter that, we can serve our API and finish our main logic:\nif err := server.Serve(); err != nil {\n    log.Fatalln(err)\n}\n\nPutting that all together, we have the following main function:\nfunc main() {\n    // load embedded swagger file\n    swaggerSpec, err := loads.Analyzed(restapi.SwaggerJSON, \"\")\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatalln(err)\n    }\n\n    // create new service API\n    api := operations.NewGreeterAPI(swaggerSpec)\n    server := restapi.NewServer(api)\n    defer server.Shutdown()\n\n    // parse flags\n    flag.Parse()\n    // set the port this service will be run on\n    server.Port = *portFlag\n\n    // TODO: Set Handle\n\n    // serve API\n    if err := server.Serve(); err != nil {\n        log.Fatalln(err)\n    }\n}\n\nNow that we have our server defined, let's give it a first spin!\nYou can run it from our root directory using the following command:\n$ go run ./cmd/greeter/main.go --port 3000\nLet's now try to call our only defined operation,\nusing the httpie cli:\n$ http get :3000/hello\nSadly this gives us the following output:\nHTTP/1.1 501 Not Implemented\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 50\nContent-Type: text/plain\nDate: Thu, 26 Jan 2017 13:09:52 GMT\n\noperation GetGreeting has not yet been implemented\n\nThe good news is that our OpenAPI-based Golang service is working.\nThe bad news is that we haven't implemented our handlers yet.\nWe'll need one handler per operation, that does the actual logic.\nYou might wonder why it does give us a sane response, rather then panicking.\nAfter grepping for that error message, or using a recursive search in your favorite editor, you'll find that this error originates from the greeter API constructor (NewGreeterAPI) found in ./gen/restapi/operations/greeter_api.go.\nHere we'll see that all our consumers, producers and handlers have sane defaults.\nSo now that we know that we just got our ass saved by go-swagger,\nlet's actually start working towards implementing our handlers.\nInspecting the gen/restapi/operations/get_greeting.go file,\nwe'll find the following snippet:\n// GetGreetingHandlerFunc turns a function with the right signature into a get greeting handler\ntype GetGreetingHandlerFunc func(GetGreetingParams) middleware.Responder\n\n// Handle executing the request and returning a response\nfunc (fn GetGreetingHandlerFunc) Handle(params GetGreetingParams) middleware.Responder {\n    return fn(params)\n}\n\nHere we can read that there is a function type GetGreetingHandlerFunc, defined for the getGreeting operation which takes in one parameter of type GetGreetingParams and returns a middleware.Responder. This is the type alias our Handler has to adhere to.\nA bit more down we'll also encounter an interface GetGreetingHandler, defined for the getGreeting operation:\n// GetGreetingHandler interface for that can handle valid get greeting params\ntype GetGreetingHandler interface {\n    Handle(GetGreetingParams) middleware.Responder\n}\n\nIts only defined method looks very similar to the function type GetGreetingHandlerFunc function defined above. This is no coincidence.\nEven better, the GetGreetingHandlerFunc implements the Handle function as defined by the GetGreetingHandler interface, meaning that we can use a function respecting the type alias as defined by GetGreetingHandlerFunc, where we normally would have to implement a struct adhering to the GetGreetingHandler interface.\nImplementing our handler as a struct always us to handle with certain state in mind. You can check out the kvstore example to see a more elaborate example, where you can see the handlers being implemented using a struct per operation.\nOur Greeter API is however simple enough, that we'll opt for just a simple method.\nKISS never grows old. So with all of this said, let's implement our one and only handler.\nBack to the ./cmd/greeter/main.go file, we'll define our handler as follows:\napi.GetGreetingHandler = operations.GetGreetingHandlerFunc(\n    func(params operations.GetGreetingParams) middleware.Responder {\n        name := swag.StringValue(params.Name)\n        if name == \"\" {\n            name = \"World\"\n        }\n\n        greeting := fmt.Sprintf(\"Hello, %s!\", name)\n        return operations.NewGetGreetingOK().WithPayload(greeting)\n    })\n\nWhich replaces the TODO: Set Handle comment, originally defined.\nLet's break down the snippet above.\nFirst we make use of the go-openapi/swag package, which is full of Goodies.\nIn this case we use the StringValue function which transforms a *string into a string. The result will be empty in case it was nil. This comes in handy as we know that our parameter can be nil when not given, as it is not required. Finally we form our greeting and return it as our payload with our 200 OK response.\nLet's run our server:\n$ go run ./cmd/greeter/main.go --port 3000\nAnd now we're ready to test our greeter API once again:\n$ http get :3000/hello\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 13\nContent-Type: text/plain\nDate: Thu, 26 Jan 2017 13:47:49 GMT\n\nHello, World!\n\nHurray, let's now greet Swagger:\n$ http get :3000/hello name==Swagger\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nConnection: close\nContent-Length: 15\nContent-Type: text/plain\nDate: Thu, 26 Jan 2017 13:48:40 GMT\n\nHello, Swagger!\n\nGreat, Swagger will be happy to hear that.\nAs we just learned, using go-swagger and a manually defined OpenAPI2.0 specification file, we can build a Golang service with minimal effort. Please read the other go-swagger docs for more information about how to use it and its different elements.\nAlso please checkout the kvstore example for a more complex example.\nIt is the main inspiration for this tutorial and has been built using the exact\nsame techniques as described in this tutorial.\n"},"tutorial/dynamic.html":{"url":"tutorial/dynamic.html","title":"Dynamic Server","keywords":"","body":"Dynamic API definition\nThe toolkit supports building a swagger specification entirely with go code. It does allow you to serve a spec up quickly. This is one of the building blocks required to serve up stub APIs and to generate a test server with predictable responses, however this is not as bad as it sounds...\n\nThis tutorial uses the todo list application to serve a swagger based API defined entirely in go code.\nBecause we know what we want the spec to look like, first we'll just build the entire spec with the interal dsl.\nLoading the specification\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"log\"\n    \"os\"\n\n    \"github.com/go-openapi/loads\"\n    \"github.com/go-openapi/loads/fmts\"\n)\n\nfunc init() {\n    loads.AddLoader(fmts.YAMLMatcher, fmts.YAMLDoc)\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n    if len(os.Args) == 1 {\n        log.Fatalln(\"this command requires the swagger spec as argument\")\n    }\n    log.Printf(\"loading %q as contract for the server\", os.Args[1])\n\n    specDoc, err := loads.Spec(os.Args[1])\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatalln(err)\n    }\n\n    log.Println(\"Would be serving:\", specDoc.Spec().Info.Title)\n}\n\nsee source of this code\nRunning this would confirm that we can in fact read a swagger spec from disk. \nThe init method enables loading of yaml based specifications.

Because we have no implementation yet, we register a notImplemented handler for all of them.\nOur api descriptor validation is now satisfied, so we use the simplest way to start a http server in go on port 8000.\nServer terminal:\ngit:(master) ✗ -!? » go run main.go ./swagger.yml\n2016/10/08 23:35:18 loading \"./swagger.yml\" as contract for the server\n2016/10/08 23:35:18 serving A To Do list application at http://localhost:8000\nClient terminal:\ngit:(master) ✗ -!? » curl -i localhost:8000\nHTTP/1.1 501 Not Implemented\nContent-Type: application/io.goswagger.examples.todo-list.v1+json\nDate: Sun, 09 Oct 2016 06:36:11 GMT\nContent-Length: 18\n\n\"not implemented\"\n\n\nThere is a lot more to be done to make this server a production ready server, but for the\npurpose of this tutorial, this is enough.\n\nCompletely untyped\nAt this point we're ready to actually implement some functionality for our Todo list. We'll create methods to add, update and delete an item.\nWe'll also render a list of known items. Because http APIs can get concurrent access we need to take care of this as well.\nThe first thing we'll do is build our \"backend\", a very simple implementation based on a slice and maps.\nvar items = []map[string]interface{}{\n    map[string]interface{}{\"id\": int64(1), \"description\": \"feed dog\", \"completed\": true},\n    map[string]interface{}{\"id\": int64(2), \"description\": \"feed cat\"},\n}\n\nvar itemsLock = &sync.Mutex{}\nvar lastItemID int64 = 2\n\nfunc newItemID() int64 {\n    return atomic.AddInt64(&lastItemID, 1)\n}\n\nfunc addItem(item map[string]interface{}) {\n    itemsLock.Lock()\n    defer itemsLock.Unlock()\n    item[\"id\"] = newItemID()\n    items = append(items, item)\n}\n\nfunc updateItem(id int64, body map[string]interface{}) (map[string]interface{}, error) {\n    itemsLock.Lock()\n    defer itemsLock.Unlock()\n\n    item, err := itemByID(id)\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    delete(body, \"id\")\n    for k, v := range body {\n        item[k] = v\n    }\n    return item, nil\n}\n\nfunc removeItem(id int64) {\n    itemsLock.Lock()\n    defer itemsLock.Unlock()\n\n    var newItems []map[string]interface{}\n    for _, item := range items {\n        if item[\"id\"].(int64) != id {\n            newItems = append(newItems, item)\n        }\n    }\n    items = newItems\n}\n\nfunc itemByID(id int64) (map[string]interface{}, error) {\n    for _, item := range items {\n        if item[\"id\"].(int64) == id {\n            return item, nil\n        }\n    }\n    return nil, errors.NotFound(\"not found: item %d\", id)\n}\n\nsee source of this code\nThe backend code builds a todo-list-item store that's save for concurrent access buy guarding every operation with a lock. This is all in memory so as soon as you quit the process all your changes will be reset.\nBecause we now have an actual implemenation that we can use for testings, lets hook that up in our API:\nfunc main() {\n    if len(os.Args) == 1 {\n        log.Fatalln(\"this command requires the swagger spec as argument\")\n    }\n    log.Printf(\"loading %q as contract for the server\", os.Args[1])\n\n

That means that you can start the API server immediately after generating it. It will respond to all valid requests with 501 Not Implemented.

To do that you have to edit the configure_xxx.go file.  That file will only be generated the first time you generate a server application from a swagger spec. So the generated server uses this file to let you fill in the blanks.\nFor the todolist application that file looks like:\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"github.com/go-openapi/errors\"\n    \"github.com/go-openapi/runtime\"\n    \"github.com/go-openapi/runtime/middleware\"\n\n    \"github.com/go-openapi/examples/todo-list/restapi/operations\"\n    \"github.com/go-openapi/examples/todo-list/restapi/operations/todos\"\n)\n\n// This file is safe to edit. Once it exists it will not be overwritten\n\nfunc configureAPI(api *operations.ToDoListAPI) http.Handler {\n    // configure the api here\n    api.JSONConsumer = httpkit.JSONConsumer()\n\n    api.JSONProducer = httpkit.JSONProducer()\n\n    api.KeyAuth = func(token string) (interface{}, error) {\n        return nil, errors.NotImplemented(\"api key auth (key) x-petstore-token from header has not yet been implemented\")\n    }\n\n    api.AddOneHandler = todos.AddOneHandlerFunc(func(params todos.AddOneParams, principal interface{}) middleware.Responder {\n        return middleware.NotImplemented(\"operation addOne has not yet been implemented\")\n    })\n    api.DestroyOneHandler = todos.DestroyOneHandlerFunc(func(params todos.DestroyOneParams, principal interface{}) middleware.Responder {\n        return middleware.NotImplemented(\"operation destroyOne has not yet been implemented\")\n    })\n    api.FindHandler = todos.FindHandlerFunc(func(params todos.FindParams, principal interface{}) middleware.Responder {\n        return middleware.NotImplemented(\"operation find has not yet been implemented\")\n    })\n    api.UpdateOneHandler = todos.UpdateOneHandlerFunc(func(params todos.UpdateOneParams, principal interface{}) middleware.Responder {\n        return middleware.NotImplemented(\"operation updateOne has not yet been implemented\")\n    })\n\n    return setupGlobalMiddleware(api.Serve(setupMiddlewares))\n}\n\nWhen you look at the code for the configureAPI method then you'll notice that the api object has properties for consumers.\nA consumer is an object that can marshal things from a wireformat to an object.  Consumers and their counterpart producers who write objects get their names generated from the consumes and produces properties on a swagger specification.\nThe interface definitions for consumers and producers look like this:\n// ConsumerFunc represents a function that can be used as a consumer\ntype ConsumerFunc func(io.Reader, interface{}) error\n\n// Consume consumes the reader into the data parameter\nfunc (fn ConsumerFunc) Consume(reader io.Reader, data interface{}) error {\n    return fn(reader, data)\n}\n\n// Consumer implementations know how to bind the values on the provided interface to\n// data provided by the request body\ntype Consumer interface {\n    // Consume performs the binding of request values\n    Consume(io.Reader, interface{}) error\n}\n\n// ProducerFunc represents a function that can be used as a producer\ntype ProducerFunc func(io.Writer, interface{}) error\n\n// Produce produces the response for the provided data\nfunc (f ProducerFunc) Produce(writer io.Writer, data interface{}) error {\n    return f(writer, data)\n}\n\n// Producer implementations know how to turn the provided interface into a valid\n// HTTP response\ntype Producer interface {\n    // Produce writes to the http response\n    Produce(io.Writer, interface{}) error\n}\n\nSo it's something that can turn a reader into a hydrated interface. A producer is the counterpart of a consumer and writes objects to an io.Writer.  When you configure an api with those you make sure it can marshal the types for the supported content types.\nGo swagger automatically provides consumers and producers for known media types. To register a new mapping for a media\ntype or to override an existing mapping, call the corresponding API functions in your configure_xxx.go file:\nfunc configureAPI(api *operations.ToDoListAPI) http.Handler {\n    // other setup code here...\n\n    api.RegisterConsumer(\"application/pkcs10\", myCustomConsumer)\n    api.RegisterProducer(\"application/pkcs10\", myCustomProducer)\n}\n\nThe next thing that happens in the configureAPI method is setting up the authentication with a stub handler in this case. This particular swagger specification supports token based authentication and as such it wants you to configure a token auth handler.  Any error for an authentication handler is assumed to be an invalid authentication and will return the 401 status code.\n// UserPassAuthentication authentication function\ntype UserPassAuthentication func(string, string) (interface{}, error)\n\n// TokenAuthentication authentication function\ntype TokenAuthentication func(string) (interface{}, error)\n\n// AuthenticatorFunc turns a function into an authenticator\ntype AuthenticatorFunc func(interface{}) (bool, interface{}, error)\n\n// Authenticate authenticates the request with the provided data\nfunc (f AuthenticatorFunc) Authenticate(params interface{}) (bool, interface{}, error) {\n    return f(params)\n}\n\n// Authenticator represents an authentication strategy\n// implementations of Authenticator know how to authenticate the\n// request data and translate that into a valid principal object or an error\ntype Authenticator interface {\n    Authenticate(interface{}) (bool, interface{}, error)\n}\n\nSo we finally get to configuring our route handlers. For each operation there exists an interface so that implementations have some freedom to provide alternative implentations. For example mocks in certain tests, automatic stubbing handlers, not implemented handlers. Let's look at the addOne handler in a bit more detail.\n// AddOneHandlerFunc turns a function with the right signature into a add one handler\ntype AddOneHandlerFunc func(AddOneParams, interface{}) middleware.Responder\n\n// Handle executing the request and returning a response\nfunc (fn AddOneHandlerFunc) Handle(params AddOneParams, principal interface{}) middleware.Responder {\n    return fn(params, principal)\n}\n\n// AddOneHandler interface for that can handle valid add one params\ntype AddOneHandler interface {\n    Handle(AddOneParams, interface{}) middleware.Responder\n}\n\nBecause the addOne operation requires authentication, this interface definition requires 2 arguments. The first argument is about the request parameters and the second parameter is the security principal for the request.  In this case it is of type interface{}, typically that is a type like Account, User, Session, ...\nIt is your job to provide such a handler. Go swagger guarantees that by the time the request processing ends up at the handler, the parameters and security principal have been bound and validated.  So you can safely proceed with saving the request body to some persistence medium perhaps.\nThere is a context that gets created where the handlers get wired up into a http.Handler. For the add one this looks like this:\n// NewAddOne creates a new http.Handler for the add one operation\nfunc NewAddOne(ctx *middleware.Context, handler AddOneHandler) *AddOne {\n    return &AddOne{Context: ctx, Handler: handler}\n}\n\n/*AddOne swagger:route POST / todos addOne\n\nAddOne add one API\n\n*/\ntype AddOne struct {\n    Context *middleware.Context\n    Params  AddOneParams\n    Handler AddOneHandler\n}\n\nfunc (o *AddOne) ServeHTTP(rw http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    route, _ := o.Context.RouteInfo(r)\n\n    uprinc, err := o.Context.Authorize(r, route)\n    if err != nil {\n        o.Context.Respond(rw, r, route.Produces, route, err)\n        return\n    }\n    var principal interface{}\n    if uprinc != nil {\n        principal = uprinc\n    }\n\n    if err := o.Context.BindValidRequest(r, route, &o.Params); err != nil { // bind params\n        o.Context.Respond(rw, r, route.Produces, route, err)\n        return\n    }\n\n    res := o.Handler.Handle(o.Params, principal) // actually handle the request\n\n    o.Context.Respond(rw, r, route.Produces, route, res)\n\n}\n\nThe http.Handler implementation takes care of authentication, binding, user code execution and generating a response. For authentication this request would end up in the TokenAuthentication handler that was put on the api context object earlier.  When a request is authenticated it gets bound. This operation eventually requires an object that is an implementation of RequestBinder.  The AddOneParams are such an implementation:\n// RequestBinder is an interface for types to implement\n// when they want to be able to bind from a request\ntype RequestBinder interface {\n    BindRequest(*http.Request, *MatchedRoute) error\n}\n\n// AddOneParams contains all the bound params for the add one operation\n// typically these are obtained from a http.Request\n//\n// swagger:parameters addOne\ntype AddOneParams struct {\n    /*\n      In: body\n    */\n    Body *models.Item\n}\n\n// BindRequest both binds and validates a request, it assumes that complex things implement a Validatable(strfmt.Registry) error interface\n// for simple values it will use straight method calls\nfunc (o *AddOneParams) BindRequest(r *http.Request, route *middleware.MatchedRoute) error {\n    var res []error\n\n    var body models.Item\n    if err := route.Consumer.Consume(r.Body, &body); err != nil {\n        res = append(res, errors.NewParseError(\"body\", \"body\", \"\", err))\n    } else {\n        if err := body.Validate(route.Formats); err != nil {\n            res = append(res, err)\n        }\n\n        if len(res) == 0 {\n            o.Body = &body\n        }\n    }\n\n    if len(res) > 0 {\n        return errors.CompositeValidationError(res...)\n    }\n    return nil\n}\n\nIn this example there is only a body parameter, so we make use of the selected consumer to read the request body and turn it into an instance of models.Item. When the body parameter is bound, it gets validated and when validation passes no error is returned and the body property is set.  After a request is bound and validated the parameters and security principal are passed to the request handler. For this configuration that would return a 501 responder.\nGo swagger uses responders which are an interface implementation for things that can write to a response. For the generated server there are status code response and a default response object generated for every entry in the spec. For the addOne operation that are 2 objects one for the success case (201) and one for an error (default).\n// Responder is an interface for types to implement\n// when they want to be considered for writing HTTP responses\ntype Responder interface {\n    WriteResponse(http.ResponseWriter, httpkit.Producer)\n}\n\n/*AddOneCreated Created\n\nswagger:response addOneCreated\n*/\ntype AddOneCreated struct {\n\n    // In: body\n    Payload *models.Item `json:\"body,omitempty\"`\n}\n\n// WriteResponse to the client\nfunc (o *AddOneCreated) WriteResponse(rw http.ResponseWriter, producer httpkit.Producer) {\n\n    rw.WriteHeader(201)\n    if o.Payload != nil {\n        if err := producer.Produce(rw, o.Payload); err != nil {\n            panic(err) // let the recovery middleware deal with this\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n/*AddOneDefault error\n\nswagger:response addOneDefault\n*/\ntype AddOneDefault struct {\n\n    // In: body\n    Payload *models.Error `json:\"body,omitempty\"`\n}\n\n// WriteResponse to the client\nfunc (o *AddOneDefault) WriteResponse(rw http.ResponseWriter, producer httpkit.Producer) {\n\n    rw.WriteHeader(500)\n    if o.Payload != nil {\n        if err := producer.Produce(rw, o.Payload); err != nil {\n            panic(err) // let the recovery middleware deal with this\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nSo an implementer of the AddOneHandler could return one of these 2 objects and go-swagger is able to respect the contract set forward by the spec document.\nSo to implement the AddOneHandler you could do something like this.\ntodos.AddOneHandlerFunc(func(params todos.AddOneParams, principal interface{}) middleware.Responder {\n  created, err := database.Save(params.Body)\n  if err != nil {\n    return AddOneDefault{models.Error{500, err.Error()}}\n  }\n  return AddOneCreated{created}\n})\n\n"},"use/server.html":{"url":"use/server.html","title":"Usage","keywords":"","body":"Use the generated server\nThe generated server serves the API but the default implementation returns 501 Not implemented for everything. Let's\nlook into using the generated code.\n\nGo swagger primarily deals with HTTP and originally only supports the stdlib net/http interface. A typical HTTP\nrequest expects a response.  This is reflected in go-swagger where a handler is typically defined as a function of\ninput parameters to a responder.\ntype ListTravelsHandler interface {\n    Handle(ListTravelsParams) middleware.Responder\n}\n\nThe signature of this handler is one of 2 possible variations. When a handler doesn't use authentication then a handler\ninterface consists out of input parameters and a responder.\ntype AddOneAuthenticatedHandler interface {\n    Handle(AddOneParams, interface{}) middleware.Responder\n}\n\nWhen a handler does use authentication then the second argument to the handler function represents the security\nprincipal for your application. You can specify the type name for this principal at generation time by specifying the\n-P or --principal flag.\nswagger generate server -P models.User\nswagger generate client -P models.User\nWhen you would execute the generate step with that parameter for the security principal then the\nAddOneAuthenticatedHandler would look a bit like this:\ntype AddOneAuthenticatedHandler interface {\n    Handle(AddOneParams, *models.User) middleware.Responder\n}\n\nImplement handlers\nA handler is an interface/contract that defines a statically typed representation of the input and output parameters of\nan operation on your API.\nThe tool generates handlers that are stubbed with a NotImplemented response when you first generate the server.\nThe not implemented handler\nThe not implemented handler is actually a not implemented responder, it returns a responder that will always respond\nwith status code 501 and a message that lets people know it's not the fault of the client that things don't work.\nmiddleware.NotImplemented(\"operation todos.AddOne has not yet been implemented\")\n\nYour own code\nEach HTTP request expects a response of some sort, this response might have no data but it's a response none the less.\nEvery incoming request is described as a bunch of input parameters which have been validated prior to calling the\nhandler. So whenever your code is executed, the input parameters are guaranteed to be valid according to what the\nswagger specification prescribes.\nAll the input parameters have been validated, and the request has been authenticated should it have triggered\nauthentication.\nYou probably want to return something a bit more useful to the users of your API than a not implemented response.\nA possible implementation of the ListTravelsHandler interface might look like this:\ntype PublicListTravelsOK struct {\n  Body []models.Travel\n}\nfunc (m *PublicListTravelsOK) WriteResponse(rw http.ResponseWriter, producer httpkit.Producer){\n  // generated code here\n}\n\ntype PublicListTravelsError struct {\n  Body models.Error\n}\nfunc (m *PublicListTravelsOK) WriteResponse(rw http.ResponseWriter, producer httpkit.Producer){\n  // generated code here\n}\n\ntype PublicListTravelsHandler struct {\n  db interface {\n    FetchTravels(*PublicListTravelsParams) ([]models.Travel, error)\n  }\n}\n\nfunc (m *PublicListTravelsHandler) Handle(params ListTravelsParams) middleware.Responder {\n  travels, err := m.db.FetchTravels(&params)\n  if err != nil {\n    return &PublicListTravelsError{Body: models.Error{Message: err.Error()}}\n  }\n  return &PublicListTravelsOK{Body: travels}\n}\n\nIn the example above we have a handler implementation with a hypothetical database fetch interface. When the handle\nmethod is executed there are 2 possible responses for the provided parameters. There can either be an error in which\ncase the PublicListTravelsError will be returned, otherwise the PublicListTravelsOK will be returned.\nThe code generator has written the remaining code to render that response with the headers etc.\n"},"use/schemas.html":{"url":"use/schemas.html","title":"Model generation rules","keywords":"","body":"Schema generation rules\nLots of the work of go-swagger is to generate models, which can have all kinds of rules like polymorphism and\nvalidations.  Of course none of this is possible without set of rules and tradeoffs.\n\nAbout schemas\nThe general idea is that you should rarely see interface{} in the generated code.\nYou get a complete representation of a swagger document in somewhat idiomatic go.\nTo do so there is set of mapping patterns that are applied to a spec to go types:\n\ndefintion of primitive => type alias/name\ndefintion of array => type alias/name\ndefinition of map => type alias/name\ndefinition of object with properties => struct\ndefinition of ref => type alias/name\nobject with only additional properties => map[string]T\nobject with additional properties and properties => custom serializer\nschema with schema array in items => tuple (struct with properties, custom serializer)\nschema with all of => struct\nall of schema with ref => embedded value\nall of schema with properties => properties are included in struct\nadding an all of schema with just \"x-isnullable\": true or \"x-nullable\": true turns\nthe schema into a pointer when there are only other extension properties provided\n\nJSONSchema and by extension swagger allow for items that have a fixed size array\nwith schema's describing the items at each index.

It uses the go tools loader to load an application and then scans all the packages that are in use by the code base.\nThis means that for something to be discoverable it needs to be reachable by a code path triggered through the main package.\nIf an annotation is not yet supported or you want to merge with a pre-existing spec, you can use the -i parameter.\nswagger generate spec -i ./swagger.yml -o ./swagger.json\nThe idea is that there are certain things that are more easily expressed by just using yaml, to\nParsing rules\nThis command relies heavily on the way godoc works. \nThis means you should be very aware of all the things godoc supports.\n\ngodoc documenting go code\ngodoc ToHTML\ncommenting go effectively\ngodoc documentation\n\nSingle page which documents all the currently supported godoc rules:\n\ngodoc tricks\n\nThe generated code tries to avoid golint errors.\n\ngo lint\ngo lint style guide\n\nWhen an object has a title and a description field, it will use the go rules to parse those.

But when the embedded type is decorated with the swagger:allOf annotation then the all of element will be defined as a \"$ref\" property instead. For an annotated type there is also the possibility to specify an argument, the value of this argument will be used as the value for the x-class extension.

The API generated will return the OK case.\nfunc (a *Client) GetDeploy(params *GetDeployParams, authInfo runtime.ClientAuthInfoWriter) (*GetDeployOK, error) {\n    // TODO: Validate the params before sending\n    if params == nil {\n        params = NewGetDeployParams()\n    }\n\n    result, err := a.transport.Submit(&runtime.ClientOperation{\n        ID: \"getDeploy\",\n        Method: \"GET\",\n        PathPattern: \"/deploys/{deploy_id}\",\n        ProducesMediaTypes: []string{\"application/json\"},\n        ConsumesMediaTypes: []string{\"application/json\"},\n        Schemes: []string{\"https\"},\n        Params: params,\n        Reader: &GetDeployReader{formats: a.formats},\n        AuthInfo: authInfo,\n    })\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    return result.(*GetDeployOK), nil  TODO\n}\n\nDoes that mean that, if I get a non-2xx response, I should check the err to actually be a GetDeployDefault reference?\nSomething like:\nresp, err := c.Operations.GetDeploy(&params, authInfo)\nif err != nil {\n    if casted, ok := err.(models.GetDeployDefault); ok {\n        // do something here....\n    } else {\n        false, err\n    }\n}\n\n\nI've been tracing through the code in Runtime.Submit: it delegates to the GetDeployReader.ReadResponse which makes the distinction.\nHowever, it remains unclear how that response is actually surfaced.\n\nAnswer: you can get pretty close to that with something like:\ncasted, ok := err.(*operations.GetDeployDefault)\n\nBecause it's a struct type it will be a pointer.\nOriginally from issue #616.\nHow to avoid deep copies of complex data structures that need to be marshalled across the API?\nUse-Case:\n\nAn API that provides access to a complex data structure, defined and governed by a subsystem, should not have to spec the\nsame data model to be marshalled, as this would require a deep copy of the data structure from the subsystem to the API layer's\nmodel universe.\n\nHow do others deal with this problem?\n\nIf your question is \"How do I write arbitrary response bodies from go-swagger generated server code?\" \n(e.g. from subsystem structs that you have marshalled) then you may want to write your own middleware.Responder,\nwhich gives you direct access to the underlying http.ResponseWriter.\nAt this point, though, why use go-swagger instead  of a lighter-weight framework?\nIf your question is \"how can I generate a swagger spec from my subsystem structs?\", then you could check out the swagger generate\nspec CLI command.\n\n\nFurther, a subsystem that builds a complex hierarchical data structure to support its own requirements for efficiency,\naccess, and serialization does not want the types of the API data model to be injected into its namespace.\nEventually, the subsystem can exist in many different contexts beyond the API, which is another reason it should not\nbecome dependent on any API type.\n\n\nSimilar Use-Case:\n\nA new requirement is proposed that wants API access to that complex data structure, and we decide to use go-swagger for that\nimplementation. It is a pure 'read' requirement, so no need for parameter validation by the API, just the ability to gain an XML\nor JSON form of the data structure by a client.\nOur organization decided to keep the API and subsystem layers separate, and to perform deep copies between them.\nThe runtime performance costs are acceptable to us, and worth it to keep API-layer dependencies out of our core library.\nIf someone can think of a better solution we would love to know!\nIf we define a data model in the swagger specification, we end up having to do a\ndeep copy of that data structure from subsystem to API if we want to avoid type injection.\n\nHow do you use the swagger spec to define a raw JSON or XML transfer, defined by the subsystem's types?\nHint: you may use the x-go-type model annotation that allows you to use pre-existing types as models, you annotate your spec like this:\nhttps://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/blob/master/fixtures/codegen/existing-model.yml#L84-L88\nOriginally from issue #948.\n\nBack to all contributions\n"},"faq/faq_server.html":{"url":"faq/faq_server.html","title":"Server generation & customization","keywords":"","body":"\nServer generation and customization\nWhat are the dependencies required by the generated server?\nThe code generation process ends with a message indicating package dependencies for your generated code.\nBasically, here are the required packages:\n\ngithub.com/go-openapi/errors\ngithub.com/go-openapi/loads\ngithub.com/go-openapi/runtime\ngithub.com/go-openapi/spec\ngithub.com/go-openapi/strfmt\ngithub.com/go-openapi/swag\ngithub.com/go-openapi/validate\ngithub.com/tylerb/graceful\n\nAnd depending on your generation options, a command line flags handling package:\n\ngithub.com/jessevdk/go-flags, or\ngithub.com/spf13/pflags\n\nThese packages may of course be vendored with your own source.\nOriginally from issue #1085.\nHow to add custom flags?\ngo-swagger ships with an option to select a flag management package: swagger generate server --flag-strategy=[go-flags|pflag]\nYou may of course customize your server to accept arbitrary flags the way you prefer.\nThis should be normally done with the generated main.go.

You would do this in the main file.\nSubsequently it's probably a good idea to generate code with --exclude-main so the update is preserved.\nSee also: https://github.com/spf13/pflag#supporting-go-flags-when-using-pflag\nExample:\nimport (\n    goflag \"flag\"\n    flag \"github.com/spf13/pflag\"\n)\n\nvar ip *int = flag.Int(\"flagname\", 1234, \"help message for flagname\")\n\nfunc main() {\n    flag.CommandLine.AddGoFlagSet(goflag.CommandLine)\n    flag.Parse()\n}\n\nOriginally from issue #762.\nHow to serve two or more swagger specs from one server?\nUse-case: I want a go-swagger generated server to serve 2 swagger specs that have no overlap on paths.\nOne is a generic metadata api that is implemented by many services and the other is a\nservice-specific api. The built-in server.go template Server struct, by having exactly\none API & handler, appears to prevent this.\nSuggestions:\n\nUse go-swagger mixin command to merge specs into a single one\nCreate yourself a top-level swagger file that just includes the two lower-level ones (using $ref).\nYou may use go-swagger flatten to flatten the resulting spec\nYou can also make your own main function and use the code from the generation\nof both spec (with --skip-main).\nThis allows for customization like using a different middleware stack, which in turn gives you\nthe ability to serve 2 swagger specs at different paths.\n\nOriginally from issue #1005. (comes with a sample main.go for spec composition).\nHow to access access API struct inside operator handler?\nUse-Case:\nmy question is how can I access the generated API interface from within an operation handler function ?\nCan i pass it somehow via context or any other way to do that?\nAnswer: No. It's not reachable from within the handler anywhere.\n\nI created a module like apache access module ACL based on IP address for different URLs.\nInstead of URL for lookup key I decided to use Operation.ID.\nLookup would be faster in that way because each operation has a unique id according to swagger specification.\nThe problem comes when I want to check against that ACL of mine...\n\nSuggestions: \nThis is possible in 2 ways.\n\nfirst way is by using an authenticator,\nthe second way is making a middleware (not global)\n\nExample with Authenticator:\n// Authenticator represents an authentication strategy\n// implementations of Authenticator know how to authenticate the\n// request data and translate that into a valid principal object or an error\ntype Authenticator interface {\n    Authenticate(interface{}) (bool, interface{}, error)\n}\n\nYou may see the schemes currently supported here: https://github.com/go-openapi/runtime/tree/master/security\nExample with Middleware:\n// The middleware configuration is for the handler executors. These do not apply to the swagger.json document.\n// The middleware executes after routing but before authentication, binding and validation\nfunc setupMiddlewares(handler http.Handler) http.Handler {\n    return handler\n}\n\nto get to the matched route in one of those you can:\nimport \"github.com/gorilla/context\"\ncontext.Get(3, request)\n\nThat gets you a matched route.\n\nNote: it might be worth it to expose Context as an exported method on the API builder.\nThat would be a simple PR to add the following code in go-swagger\nfunc (o *LifecycleManagerAPI) Context() *middleware.Context {\n    if o.context == nil {\n        o.context = middleware.NewRoutableContext(o.spec, o, nil)\n    }\n    return o.context\n}\n\nthen your middleware could take a context in and use RouteInfo(request) like this one: https://github.com/go-openapi/runtime/blob/master/middleware/security.go.\n\nSimilar use-case:\nI have some domain objects I need access to in the handlers (db connection, telemetry client, etc).\nWhat is the recommended way/place to define these and access them in the handlers?\n\nWould I define them in configure_xxx() and make wrapper functions for the handlers to make them accessible?\nOr is there a nice way to add them to the context?\nI was looking for some examples of this but couldn't find anything.\n\nHint: look at this one: https://github.com/go-openapi/kvstore\nThe important takeaway is that main and the handlers have to be pulled outside of the generated code since only configure_xxx() is protected.\nAnd main() doesn't call configureAPI() ...\nthat was a little confusing looking through the other examples and not seeing any changes to the vanilla config code.\nSimilar use-case: dependency injection\nWouldn't it be better to have all the handlers automatically be part of a default struct that simply has a Context member variable or empty interface? \n\nThat would save everyone a lot of copy/pasta when we need to inject some info.\nI mean, a different context than the one available on params.HTTPRequest.Context(),\nmore like an application level context, e.g. something I can stuff a database reference or other business state into.\n\nHint: remember that the generated packages are made of a series of files that you can extend and tailor to your own needs by adding more files.\nFor instance, a new (non generated) file in the operations package could bring to life the applicative context/dependencies injection and be called from the configure_xxx.\nYou may alternatively modify the generation by providing your own templates, and possibly extend the interface of the Server struct.\nOriginally from issue #661.\nUse go-swagger to generate different client or servers\nUse-Case:\nI am using go-swagger to generate some part of a server application automatically\nand I would love to reuse our code by transforming the code in go templates.\n\nIt would be  enough to export the appGenerator type and have a function that returns it (maybe generator.GenerateServer itself?).\nI would then use appGenerator to execute the templates.\nHow could I realize this? Is it possible with go-swagger?\n\nAnswer: you can provide your own templates for go-swagger.\nThe client and server generators allow you to specify a directory on disk to add custom templates.\nHere are some docs: http://goswagger.io/generate/templates/\n\nIn VIC they do this: https://github.com/vmware/vic/tree/master/lib/apiservers/templates\nhttps://github.com/vmware/vic/blob/master/Makefile#L274-L281\n\nHint: you can also override templates by using the same names:\nhttps://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/blob/master/generator/templates.go#L61-L73\nWouldn't this generate roughly the same structure of the server?\n\nI don't want to change minor details, I want to have code that looks totally different\n(but only for the server part, models and clients are more than okay) while using code the parsing and validation from go-swagger.\nThis means different number of files and different functionalities.\n\nAnswer: yes, it would generate a similar structure.\nNote: customizing templates already brings many options to the table, including generating artifacts in other languages than go.\nThere is some documentation on the config file format here: https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/blob/gen-layout-configfile/docs/use/template_layout.md\nAlso keep in mind that go-openapi and go-swagger constitute a toolkit\nand provide you the tools to adapt to your own use case.\nThe swagger command line and standard templates only covers general purpose use-cases.\nIf you think your use-case would benefit to many people, feel free to make the necessary changes for your case to work and submitting a PR. \nExample config file for generation:\nlayout:\n  application:\n    - name: configure\n      source: asset:serverConfigureapi\n      target: \"{{ joinFilePath .Target .ServerPackage }}\"\n      file_name: \"{{ .Name }}_client.go\"\n      skip_exists: true\n    - name: main\n      source: asset:serverMain\n      target: \"{{ joinFilePath .Target \\\"cmd\\\" (dasherize (pascalize .Name)) }}-server\"\n      file_name: \"main.go\"\n    - name: embedded_spec\n      source: asset:swaggerJsonEmbed\n      target: \"{{ joinFilePath .Target .ServerPackage }}\"\n      file_name: \"embedded_spec.go\"\n    - name: server\n      source: asset:serverServer\n      target: \"{{ joinFilePath .Target .ServerPackage }}\"\n      file_name: \"server.go\"\n    - name: builder\n      source: asset:serverBuilder\n      target: \"{{ joinFilePath .Target .ServerPackage .Package }}\"\n      file_name: \"{{ snakize (pascalize .Name) }}_api.go\"\n    - name: doc\n      source: asset:serverDoc\n      target: \"{{ joinFilePath .Target .ServerPackage }}\"\n      file_name: \"doc.go\"\n  models:\n   - name: definition\n     source: asset:model\n     target: \"{{ joinFilePath .Target .ModelPackage }}\"\n     file_name: \"{{ (snakize (pascalize .Name)) }}.go\"\n  operations:\n   - name: parameters\n     source: asset:serverParameter\n     target: \"{{ joinFilePath .Target .ServerPackage .APIPackage .Package }}\"\n     file_name: \"{{ (snakize (pascalize .Name)) }}_parameters.go\"\n   - name: responses\n     source: asset:serverResponses\n     target: \"{{ joinFilePath .Target .ServerPackage .APIPackage .Package }}\"\n     file_name: \"{{ (snakize (pascalize .Name)) }}_responses.go\"\n   - name: handler\n     source: asset:serverOperation\n     target: \"{{ joinFilePath .Target .ServerPackage .APIPackage .Package }}\"\n     file_name: \"{{ (snakize (pascalize .Name)) }}.go\"\n\nHow to use swagger-ui cors?\nAnswer: you can add a cors middleware.\nLike: https://github.com/rs/cors\nDocumentation on how to customize middleware\nWorking example (in configure_name.go):\nimport \"github.com/rs/cors\"\n\nfunc setupGlobalMiddleware(handler http.Handler) http.Handler {\n    handleCORS := cors.Default().Handler\n    return handleCORS(handler)\n}\n\nOriginally from issue #481.\nSupport streaming responses\nUse-Case: Docker client expects a stream of JSON structs from daemon to show a progress bar, as in:\ncurl -i -X POST http://IP:PORT/images/create?fromImage=alpine&tag=latest\n\nHow could I write a server providing a streaming response?\nAnswer: Operations in the generated server are expected to return a responder.\nThis interface is defined as:\n// Responder is an interface for types to implement\n// when they want to be considered for writing HTTP responses\ntype Responder interface {\n    WriteResponse(http.ResponseWriter, httpkit.Producer)\n}\n\nWith the middleware.ResponderFunc helper construct, you can just write a func(http.ResponseWriter, httpkit.Producer)\nwhere you want a streaming response.\nThis should be sufficient. However:\n\nI've toyed with a channel based stream where you send struct objects to a channel, which then gets streamed to the browser.\nI decided against this because it seemed to just add complexity for little benefit.\nI can be persuaded to implement such a responder though, and should somebody send a PR like that I would not say no to it.\n\nOriginally from issue Originally from issue #305.\n\nBack to all contributions\n"},"faq/faq_client.html":{"url":"faq/faq_client.html","title":"Client generation","keywords":"","body":"\nClient generation\nExample for dynamic client?\nUse-case: I have the swagger spec file for an existing 3rd party REST service for their application.\nA dynamic client would allow me to load the swagger spec file and provide the ability to formulate requests and parse responses\nbased on the loaded spec file.\nFor e.g. there are REST client packages for go, like go-resty, that provide a nice interface\nto interact with a REST server, but go-resty doesn't understand swagger specs.\n\nJust like the untyped dynamic server example in go-swagger, is there an example for a dynamic client?\nCan a REST client be created at runtime by loading a swagger spec file, without going through a code generation and compilation?\nCan I get the REST client functionality without first generating a client using go-swagger and then\ncompiling it back into the code.\nCan this be done dynamically like the dynamic server example?\n\nAnswer: you can't currently.\nYou'd have to do by hand everything the code generator does for you. Every time the API changes, you would have to do this again.\nThe use case for the server side is covered but not the client side.\nThat being said, you might find this test useful as an example:\nruntime test\nOriginally from issue #996.\nCan we set a User-Agent header?\nUse-Case: we would like to be able to set an arbitrary user-agent header either at client generation time or at compile time.\nIs it possible to do this?\n\nThe Swagger specification is irrelevant in this case because we are using the same specification to generate many clients.\n\nAnswer: here is the outline of how to achieve that.\n\nYou can use a custom transport which allows you to set the user agent.\nhttps://github.com/go-openapi/runtime/blob/master/client/runtime.go#L132\nThen you can configure it with this constructor method\nhttps://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/blob/master/examples/todo-list/client/todo_list_client.go#L52\nYou can also configure that runtime with a stdlib http.Client\nhttps://github.com/go-openapi/runtime/blob/master/client/runtime.go#L167\nYou can extend intercept a http request with the http.RoundTripper interface. https://godoc.org/net/http#RoundTripper\nwhich you can set here: https://github.com/go-openapi/runtime/blob/master/client/runtime.go#L116\nso for the client here:\n\nvar myRoundTripper http.RoundTripper = createRoundTripper()\ntransport := httptransport.New(cfg.Host, cfg.BasePath, cfg.Schemes)\ntransport.Transport = myRoundTripper\ntodoListClient := New(transport, nil)\n\nOther use-Case: can the same pattern of using an http.RoundTripper be used to implement the AWS Signature v4 which requires\nreading and modifying the *http.Request before its sent?\nAnswer: yes it can.\n\nThe roundtripper is the last thing executed before sending the request on the wire.\n\nSee also issue #935.\nOriginally from issue #911.\n\nBack to all contributions\n"},"faq/faq_spec.html":{"url":"faq/faq_spec.html","title":"Spec generation from source","keywords":"","body":"\nSpec generation from source\nIs there an example to generate a swagger spec document from the code?\nUse-Case: I have read the swagger.json generation and feel confused.

I see mixed examples about this.\n\n\nAnswers:\n\nQ1: nope. It needs to be declared in the same app and it needs to be imported so that goswagger can find it by following imports starting at the main package.\nQ2: you would add all of them in the parameter struct at this moment, in the case of parameters you would add a doc comment: // in: path. Take a look at some of the generated code examples because they contain all the known annotations as well.\nQ3: not case sensitive, didn't want to have debates over casing. Whatever looks good to you in docs is what you can use.\n\nOne more question: Can methods in an interface be annotated?\nAnswer: only when it's used in a discriminator IIRC. There is code in the scan package that treats nullary methods as properties if certain conditions are met.\n\nMy generated spec is now working but seems to be missing a parameter \"description\" to indicate to end user of the API URL endpoint of what's its doing. Example below, I wanted the line \"Disable/enable a compute node EC2 machine with a given IP address\" to show up as some sorta of description for the parameter... Am I missing something?\n\n// v2PutXXX disable/enable a compute node EC2 machine with a given IP address\n//\n// swagger:route PUT /compute/nodes/{nodeIPAddress} v2PutXXX\n//\n// Disable/enable a compute node machine with a given IP address\n//\n// Produces:\n// - application/json\n//\n// Consumes:\n// - application/json\n//\n// Schemes: http\n//\n// Responses:\n// default: errorResp\n// 200: okResp\n//\nfunc v2PutXXX(....)\n\nAnswer: you still need to add enlist a struct as parameters for the operation.\nhttps://goswagger.io/generate/spec/params.html\nIs there an example how to generate example values from the code?\nAnswer: I don't think that is supported at the moment\nOriginally from issue #213.\nExtra function in example?\nIn file: go-swagger/fixtures/goparsing/classification/operations/todo_operation.go,\nFunc: mountItem looks like extra function. Could you explain?\nAnswer: swagger tool generates a correct specification for proposed routes without calling fake func mountItem.\nThe main rule is empty line between swagger:routes like that:\n// ServeAPI serves the API for this record store\nfunc ServeAPI(host, basePath string, schemes []string) error {\n    // swagger:route GET /pets pets users listPets\n\n    // swagger:route GET /orders

params?\nUse-Case: I defined a route with!\n// swagger:route GET /services/{serviceName}/version/{version} pets listOneService\n\nHow to comment the two params('serviceName' and 'version')?\nAnswer: swagger:params is used to indicate which operations the properties of the operation are included in the struct.\nSo you'd use something like these:\nhttps://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/blob/master/fixtures/goparsing/petstore/rest/handlers/orders.go#L24-L46\nor:\n// swagger:params listOneService\ntype ListOneParams struct {\n    //

// required: true\n    Version string `json:\"version\"`\n}\n\nOriginally from issue #668.\nEmpty definitions\nUse-Case: I don't understand how to deal with model annotation.\nWhen I generate a spec from source, I get empty definitions.\nAnswer: models are discovered through usage in parameter and/or response objects.\nIf the model isn't used through a parameter or response object it's not part of the API because there is no way that it goes in or out through the API.\nExample:\ndoc.go\n// Schemes: http, https\n// Host: localhost\n// BasePath: /v1\n// Version: 0.0.1\n// License: MIT

This allows us to discover your application and which files to scan for the doc comments.\n\nThis application needs to read composed structs and so on, and it's a lot easier to interrogate the application if you know where all the files are and not just the ones you created in this particular folder.\nUnfortunately it does require to be able to read\n\nHow about a main class that doesn't require appengine imports?\nI've personally never used appening so I don't really know what is involved.\n\nFor an app engine app, typically the main.go doesn't require any of the special appengine imports... however it uses an init() function instead of a main() function, and in there is where you instantiate the router and bind all the routes to handlers. It is the handlers (usually in their own separate files) which need the appengine imports.\n\nI don't know if that's what you are asking about, but I know app engine fairly well so I can answer more questions if you have any.\n\nI guess what I mean is if your code doesn't compile, how are you running it?\nAnd what I also meant is; if this is important to you, you could look at forking and submitting a pull request.\nI, personally, still have a bunch of other things that need fixing in here before I want to look at a niche like appengine.\n\nFair enough, if you're not interested in supporting app engine that's fine. I did try forking to fix that other bug that I filed, but the code was a bit over my head so I wasn't able to fix it.\n\nTo answer your question, app engine apps don't get compiled with \"go build\", instead they are run on a dev server provided by the app engine SDK, and then they are deployed to app engine and run on the Google Cloud Platform infrastructure. The only reason they don't compile is because some of the packages (\"appengine\", \"appengine/datastore\", etc.) are only available in this SDK environment, they are not found in $GOPATH.\n\nMaybe app engine could improve this situation in the future, and then go-swagger wouldn't have to change to support it, but as it stands now this will not work with any app engine apps that use any of the appengine-specific imports.\n\nI will go back to using github.com/yvasiyarov/swagger for now, which doesn't require the app to build to generate the spec, but it is also not generating swagger 2.0, so I hope I can use your package sometime in the future.\n\nbut the custom sdk they use also includes a custom go command doesn't it?\nI think the problem you're having is related to your GOPATH content and can be fixed there.\n\nafaik go always needs to compile your stuff, whether that's in the SDK env or not, have you tried installing go-swagger in the SDK provided GOPATH?\n\nI'll leave this open so i can track this\nHmm that is an interesting thought. I will experiment more on this today.\nThe app engine SDK definitely uses the regular system GOPATH to resolve most of the includes, but it maybe has another internal GOPATH also,\nI'm not sure. Will post my findings a bit later.\n\nWow! You're right man! All that was needed to make generate spec work, was to add this to GOPATH:\n[go_appengine_sdk_location]/goroot\n\nThe appengine includes are in there. It's working now, thanks for the insight!\n\nOriginally from issue [#47](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/47).\n-->\n\n\nBack to all contributions\n"},"faq/faq_testing.html":{"url":"faq/faq_testing.html","title":"API testing","keywords":"","body":"\nAPI testing\nAny suggestions how to leverage the generated client for benchmarking the API?\nUse-Case: I want to benchmark the throughput and latency of different API calls.\n\nI can think of using the go testing/benchmarking framework and hand role the API calls, or I can leverage the generated client and augment it with a benchmarking framework.\n\nWhat have others done?\nAt the moment, the toolkit does not generate testing tools.

However, it is not yet supported. Pull requests to move on forward in that direction are welcome.\nOriginally from issue #787.\nUsing httptest\nUse-Case: I would like to use httptest for testing my handlers.\nGo-swagger provides a Server, but not a configured handler. \nHint: I use this hack : in a file test.go in the restapi folder, I steal the private configureAPI function. It works.\npackage restapi\n\nimport (\n    loads \"github.com/go-openapi/loads\"\n    \"github.com/pim/pam/poum/restapi/operations\"\n    \"net/http\"\n)\n\nfunc getAPI() (*operations.ThefactoryAPI, error) {\n    swaggerSpec, err := loads.Analyzed(SwaggerJSON, \"\")\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    api := operations.NewThefactoryAPI(swaggerSpec)\n    return api, nil\n}\n\nfunc GetAPIHandler() (http.Handler, error) {\n    api, err := getAPI()\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    h := configureAPI(api)\n    err = api.Validate()\n    if err != nil {\n        return nil, err\n    }\n    return h, nil\n}\n\nAnd I can use this in tests like this:\nhandler, err := restapi.GetAPIHandler()\nif err != nil {\n    t.Fatal(\"get api handler\", err)\n}\nts := httptest.NewServer(handler)\ndefer ts.Close()\nres, err := http.Get(ts.URL + \"/api/v1/boxes\")\n\nBut, hacking restapi, which use my handlers is cyclic, I can't drop my test near my handlers, and this is still a hack.\nWhat is the offical way to manage handler testing?\nHint: you don't actually need httptest to test the handlers.\nA handler is essentially a function of parameters to result.\nThe result knows how to write itself to a http.ResponseWriter, and you already know that that part works.\nSo to test a handler what you require is to test just your code.\nSo to test the AddOne operation from the todo list this, there are 2 functions involved in the implementation.\nThe first function uses the data from the request to actually write the todo item to a store, this can be tested separately.\nfunc addItem(item *models.Item) error {\n    if item == nil {\n        return errors.New(500, \"item must be present\")\n    }\n\n    itemsLock.Lock()\n    defer itemsLock.Unlock()\n\n    newID := newItemID()\n    item.ID = newID\n    items[newID] = item\n\n    return nil\n}\n\nThen there is the actual handler:\ntodos.AddOneHandlerFunc(func(params todos.AddOneParams) middleware.Responder {\n    if err := addItem(params.Body); err != nil {\n        return todos.NewAddOneDefault(500).WithPayload(&models.Error{Code: 500, Message: swag.String(err.Error())})\n    }\n    return todos.NewAddOneCreated().WithPayload(params.Body)\n})\n\nTo test this second function we don't need to use the httptest package, you can assume that that part of the code works. So all you have to test is whether or not you get the right return types for a given set of parameters.\nOriginally from issue #719.\n\nBack to all contributions\n"},"faq/faq_documenting.html":{"url":"faq/faq_documenting.html","title":"Documenting your API","keywords":"","body":"\nServing swagger-ui with the API Server\nUse-Case: I was trying to serve swagger-ui from the generated API Server and\nI didn't find a straightforward enough way in the docs,\nso I've created my own swagger-ui middleware:\nfunc setupGlobalMiddleware(handler http.Handler) http.Handler {\n    return uiMiddleware(handler)\n}\n\nfunc uiMiddleware(handler http.Handler) http.Handler {\n    return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n        // Shortcut helpers for swagger-ui\n        if r.URL.Path == \"/swagger-ui\" || r.URL.Path == \"/api/help\" {\n            http.Redirect(w, r, \"/swagger-ui/\", http.StatusFound)\n            return\n        }\n        // Serving ./swagger-ui/\n        if strings.Index(r.URL.Path, \"/swagger-ui/\") == 0 {\n            http.StripPrefix(\"/swagger-ui/\", http.FileServer(http.Dir(\"swagger-ui\"))).ServeHTTP(w, r)\n            return\n        }\n        handler.ServeHTTP(w, r)\n    })\n}\n\nCan this be achieved any easier?\nAnswer: I think that's the way to do it.\nAt some point I included an embedded version of the swagger-ui in this toolkit but it became annoying to keep up to date\nand severely bloated the size of my binary.\nWhat do you say if we add swagger-ui as git submodule, include this middleware in your binary and update the docs?\nI'm reluctant to do so at this point in time because a git submodule break go-gettability.\n\nI've had it included at one point but it's so much of a moving target that it would always be outdated.\nOn top of it it are a lot of javascript and html files and people haven't been over the moon when go-swagger gets\nvendored and they see all of that.\n\nOriginally from issue #370.\nSee also: How to serve Swagger UI from a preexisting web app? #1029.\n\nBack to all contributions\n"}}}
